## Frontend

The project uses [Next.js][nextjs] project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`][create-next-app].

How to run a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

App should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Make sure that backend is running.
Default backend address is `http://localhost:8081`. But you can change it using `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` environment
variable.
